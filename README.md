# Sensitivity-Analysis-of-Meteorological-Variables-in-Load-Forecasting-Using-LSTM

This repository contains code for forecasting electrical load demand based on meteorological variables using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model. The provided data includes temperature and load demand of Washington Dc, but the model can be applied to different meteorological variables such as relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed, dew point, and more.

## **Key Features**

- Utilizes LSTM deep learning model for load forecasting.
- Implements a random search technique to optimize LSTM network design and hyperparameters.
- Examines five essential hyperparameters: number of epochs, batch size, number of neurons, number of hidden layers, and dropout rate.
- Leverages TensorFlow and the Keras Tuner tool for automated hyperparameter tuning experiments.
